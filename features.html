            <div class="destext">
               <p>Tutorials are short courses focusing on learning the ropes of how to play as each character in the roster. Those can be found in the main menu under the icon shown here.</p>
               <p>Currently, only the tutorials for Mario, Sonic, and Shadow are considered complete.</p>

         <h2>Achievements</h2>

            <div>
               <p>Prove your skill in Poker Boll by collecting each of the 32 achievements available. Those can range from unlocking characters to finding easter eggs across levels. Unlocking achievements is indicated by a notification on the HUD.</p>
               <p>This feature is currently a Work in Progress, yet to be finished.</p>

         <h2>Super Forms</h2>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/superforms.png">
            <div>
               <p>Collecting the 7 Chaos Emeralds allows Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy to tap into the power of Super Form, which requires them to be at least in big form and have a minimum of 50 rings. This power drains the ring counter until it reaches 0, which causes the character to detransform. Using Super Forms enchances the user's abilities and some of their moves.</p>
               <p>Super Forms are also planned for other characters, such as Knuckles, Amy, and Lilac. There'll also be some bonuses for collecting all Chaos Emeralds as other characters, like Shantae and Quote.</p>

         <h2>New Items</h2>
         <p>Poker Boll introduces two new items for characters to use, allowing for more unique abilities.</p>
         <h3>Bubble Flower</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/bubble.png">
            <p>This flower originates from Super Mario Bros. Wonder and grants the user water abilities. This item's behavior is planned to change.</p>
         </section>
         <section class="threescreenshots">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/bubble1.png">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/bubble2.png">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/bubble3.png">
         </section>
         <h3>Spark Flower
         </h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/spark.png">
            <p>This power-up is a Poker Boll original item allowing user to access electric abilities, this power-up once got resprited.</p>
         </section>
         <section class="threescreenshots">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/spark1.png">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/spark2.png">
            <img src="images/screenshots/powerups/spark3.png">
         </section>
         <p class="note">Note: A charm from vanilla Boll won't be able to use these power-ups without additional scripting and sprites.</p>

         <h2>New Biomes</h2>
         <p></p>
         <h3>Sakura</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/sakura.png">
            <p>This biome is inspired by Japanese Cherry Blossom trees and one of Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii's worlds. With the addition of bamboo assets to compliment the scenery. </p>
         </section>
         <h3>Mountain</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/mountain.png">
            <p>This biome is one of the newer additions to Poker Boll. There may be some assets coming to the remake to add to it. It was inspired by New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS with some original twists to it, like the brown coloration.</p>
         </section>

         <h2>Other Misc. Changes</h2>
         <h3>Mystery Ball</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/mysteryball.png">
            <p>It was designed to be a Bowser Jr. drop, but for now it's just another way of ending a level. It may receive a new look in future versions...</p>
         </section>
         <h3>Elemental Shields</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/elementalshields.png">
            <p>4 new visual effects have been added to PB to be used in mods, as an extension of shields.png. Shield effects can be used in charms with variables: stareff, shieldeff, fireeff, thundereff, bubbleeff and windeff.</p>
         </section>
         <h3>+ Clocks</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/+clock.png">
            <p>These come in 2 variations - blue and green. Blue + Clocks add 10 seconds to your timer, green adds a minute. This item was inspired by 3D Mario + Clocks.</p>
         </section>
         <h3>Speed and Slug Shoes</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/speedshoes.png">
            <p>Just like in Classic Sonic titles, Speed Shoes, as well as their evil counterpart - Slug Shoes, modify your speed. Speed Shoes also give you an afterimage effect.</p>
         </section>
         <h3>Commands</h3>
         <section class="description">
            <img src="images/icons/commands.png">
         <div>
         <p>Poker Boll features 2 new exclusive commands:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>nohud - Disables the HUD for clean shots
            <li>speedhoes/iseeawoman/iamspeed - Infinite speed-up effect (can be used with spaces and underscores)
            </li>
         </div>
         </section>
         <h3>New afterimages</h3>
         <section class="description">
         <img src="images/icons/afterimages.png">
         <p>Rather than flashing on and off like in base Boll, the afterimages actually fade and not make breaks in rendering.</p>
